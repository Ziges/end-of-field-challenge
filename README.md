## The task
In this exercise we build two full integrations with plain vanilla CSS, i.e. no frameworks like bootstrap, tailwind,... are allowed. 
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

1. Images and icons using:
    * www.flaticon.com/home 
    * www.fontawesome.com
    
2. 

3. 
    
4. 

5. Lastly, interface 2 is responsive meaning they stack according to screen size, for a more pleasant reading experience. 

##### I'm excited to use another framework like tailwind for this exercise.
